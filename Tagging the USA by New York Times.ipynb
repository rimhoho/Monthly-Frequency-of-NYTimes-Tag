In the second part of the season finale, the doctors at San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital continue to respond to the major earthquake that rocked their city. The crisis is testing their ingenuity and pushing their personal issues to the surface. Dr. Shaun Murphy (Freddie Highmore), the protagonist of the series, is still reeling from his latest rejection by Lea (Paige Spara), who cited Shaun’s autism as a reason not to pursue a romantic relationship with him. Undeterred, he revealed in the last episode that he hadn’t lost hope. Lea, who was trapped after the earthquake hit and eventually rescued, overheard Shaun’s comments and responded emotionally. But before they could address them, an aftershock left Shaun stranded with a patient in the flooding basement of a collapsed building.',\n",

Many conservative views lack empathy. I talk to “illegal aliens” and listen to their stories very often. I’ve talked to thousands of them over the years. I don’t even know if I could call myself a good person if I didn’t care or thought of them as not deserving to have the same rights as me, or to have the chance to work and support their families. I am by no means saying all illegal aliens are good people, but that is applicable to any group of people. I have mostly encountered people who are very eager to work, not people who are here to live off the government. I have worked at hospitals, clinics, and I can’t imagine telling these people they don’t deserve to be treated because we, as a society, don’t value their lives enough to spend our tax dollars on them. Besides, many do pay federal taxes under a fake social or someone else’s social security number and often don’t see the refund because they often work under a fake social. You can’t avoid sales tax in most states, or in most counties, and that money is what is often used for community hospitals. They also pay property taxes, even if they rent it’s already factored in by the landlord. If they don’t pay taxes, then whoever is employing them is benefiting from illegal aliens and taking advantage of the taxpayer way more than the illegal aliens are. If they are only not paying taxes it’s because they can’t, since they don’t have a valid SSN. They do work that none of us want to do. I would say that 99% of all fruits and vegetables are picked, pruned and harvested by aliens, legal (temporary visas) and illegal.  And they are only illegal because there is no path for them to be ever be legal. To come to the United States legally, you usually have to be financially stable, or a professional, a student with funds, either way, you have to be somewhat well off financially, and these people are dirt poor for the most part. They can’t go to the American embassy in Guatemala or El Salvador and say, “I want to move to Oregon.” They can’t even get a visa because they’re poor. Poor people can’t get visas. And why are they fleeing these shit countries anyway? Countries that have been affected by corruption for so many decades, they don’t give a fuck about their poor and only cater to the rich. Countries that were destabilized for decades by the US, and although that may not be the case anymore, what we are seeing are the long term effects of American intervention in Latin America. I hate the cause of illegal immigration, but not the immigrants, because I hate to see people suffering, leaving everything they know, risking their lives, just because their country is so fucking corrupt it stopped giving a fuck about them, and it didn’t care about their well-being and education; their politicians only cared about how much money they could steal and how they could benefit the rich. And don’t think that the US could never be like that. In many ways, it’s already happening. Maybe not us, but our children and grandchildren may someday want to flee from here. We have politicians and people who only work to give the rich tax cuts, who work hard to cut funding for education and healthcare. We may someday be the ones who can’t thrive and succeed.

Universal healthcare necessitates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. It doesn’t fund research of rare disease states or treatment expensive conditions. It covers cheap and common issues. What’s more, is the private research of treatments is essentially killed off because of government mandated drug prices.

And it’s better than the alternative, which leaves people unable to pay. \\n4) why are you acting as if there is a hoard of illegal immigrants waiting in hospital lines just to bleed you dry, how many illegals have you even met? \\n5)this isn’t the first time UHC has been brought up. It has been in the works since the turn of the 20th century and throughout that time, every time a new social program was put into effect to make payment easier (Medicaid, Medicare, etc) it was shut down or greatly limited by large medical associations and insurance companies. Teddy Roosevelt, FDR, Harry Truman and LBJ all promoted and tried to introduce single-payer healthcare bills. Naturally, between big businesses lobbying to shut it down and promoting fear through phrases like “socialized medicine” and “communism” in the second half of the century, many of those movements were slowed or even halted completely. There were several pushes for universal healthcare, and even Nixon expanded Medicare and Medicaid against pushback from these corporations. Ford then planned to expand it further, with taxes covering so called “catastrophic health insurance.” It’s not new, it’s not foreign. \\n\\nSo yes, there is a long history of proposed universal healthcare. The only side with any kind of real push against it is, surprise, pharmaceutical and insurance companies. They work together to artificially inflate costs and push the difference on to the consumer. \\n\\nYour fear of illegals getting help shouldn’t impact the cost of healthcare for the rest of us, that’s selfish.',\n",
